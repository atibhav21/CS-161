Graph1.txt

1. The graph in graph1.txt is unsatisfiable using 3 colors
2. The graph in graph1.txt is satisfiable using 4 colors

The above two solutions tell us that a 3-coloring of the graph doesn't exist but a 4-coloring of the graph exists.
Yes, the solution based on the results of RSAT are:

Color 1: Node 5, Node 7
Color 2: Node 3, Node 6
Color 3: Node 2, Node 4
Color 4: Node 1
